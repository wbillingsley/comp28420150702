Ye Hielands and ye Lowlands,
O, whaur hae ye been?
They hae slain the Earl o' Moray,
And laid him on the green,
He was a braw gallant,
And he rade at the ring,
And the bonny Earl o' Moray,
He might hae been a king.

Chorus
O lang will his lady
Lok frae the Castle Doune
Ere she see the Earl o' Moray
Come soundin' through the toun.

Now wae be to ye, Huntly,
And wherefore did ye sea?
I bade ye bring him wi' ye,
And forbade ye him to slay.
He was a braw gallant,
And he played at the glove;
And the bonny Earl o' Moray,
He was the Queen's true love.
